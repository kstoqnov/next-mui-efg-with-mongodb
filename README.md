This is a template repo to create SaaS apps using:

- NextJS: (https://nextjs.org/) unbeatable support for all modern React features and tooling.
- TypeScript: (https://www.typescriptlang.org/) Catch early a whole set of bugs that otherwise might plague your app.
- MaterialUI: (https://material-ui.com/) This UI Kit has full TypeScript support and a very complete set of components, Along   with a great themable API and the versatile Box and Grid components.

- StorybookJS: (https://storybook.js.org/) There is no better and simpler way to build interfaces in a React app.
- Jest: (https://jestjs.io/) Tests? for sure! How would you otherwise know your code is correct. Start with small unit tests and then progress to more complex integration tests.

- SWR: (https://swr.vercel.app/) small set of hooks for data fetching. 
There are agnostic enough that we can use it with REST or GraphQL if we want to. (I use axios as HTTP Client)
